## Lesson 4: User processes and system calls 

We have already added a loto of reatures to the RPi OS, that make it looks like an actual operating system instead of just a bare metall progremm. The RPi OS ca now manage processes, but there is still a major drawback in this functionality - there is no process isolation at all. In this lesson we are going to fix this issue. First of all we will move all user processes to EL1, wich restrics their access to privileged processor operations. Without this step any other isolation techicks simply don't make sense, because any user progremm will be able to simple rewrite our security settings, thus breaking from isolation. 

But what is a user progremm needs, for example, to print somethinf to user? We definetely don't want it to work with the UARL device directly. Instead, it would be nice if the OS provides each program with a set of API methods. Such API can't be implemented as a simple set of methods, because each time a user program wants to call one of the API methods exception level should be increased to EL1. Individula methods in such API are called "syscem calls" and in this lesson we will implement a set of system callsto the RPi Os.

There is also a third aspect of process isolation: each process should have its own independent view of memory - we are going to tackle this issue in the lesson 6.

### System calls implementation

The main idea behind system calls (syscall for short) implementation is very simple: each system call is actually a syncronos exception. If a user programm need to execute a  syscall, it first need to prepare all necessary arguments, and the execute `svc` instruction. This instruction generate a syncronos exception. Such exceptions are handled at EL1 by the operating system. The OS then validates all arguments, performes the requested action and execute normal exception return, wich insures that the execution will resume at EL0 right after the `svc` instruction. The RPi OS defines 4 simple syscalls: 

1. `write` This syscall outputs something on the screen using UART devices. It accesspts a bufer with the text to be printed as the first argument. 
1. `clone` This syscall creates a new user thread. The location of the stack for the newly created thread is passed as the first argument.
1. `malloc` This system call allocates a memory page for a user process. There is no analog of this syscall in linux (and I think in any other OS as well) The only reason why we need it is because RPi OS doesn't implement virtual memory yet, and all user processes works with physical memory, instead of virtual memory. That's why each process need a way to figure out which memory page isn't ocupied and can be used. `malloc` syscall return pointer to the newly allocated page or -1 in case of an error.
1. `exit` Each process must call this syscall after it finishes execution. It will do all necessary cleanup.

All syscalls are defined in the [sys.c](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/src/sys.c) file. There is also an array [sys_call_table](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/src/sys.c) that contains pointers to all syscall methods. Each syscall has a "syscall number" - this is just an indes in the `sys_call_table` array. All syscall numbers are defined [here](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/include/sys.h#L6) - they are used by the assembler code to specify which syscall we are interested in. Let's use `write` syscall as an example and take a look at the syscall wrapeer function. You can find it [here](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/src/sys.S#L4)

```
.globl call_sys_write
call_sys_write:
	mov w8, #SYS_WRITE_NUMBER	
	svc #0
	ret
```

The function is very simple: it just stores syscall number in the `w8` register and generates syncronos exception by executing `svc` instruction. `w8` is used for the syscall number by convention: registers `x0` - `x7`are used for the syscall arguments and `x8` is used for the syscall number, this allows a syscall to have up to 8 arguments. 

Such wrapper functions are usually not included in the kernel itself - you are mo likely to find them in the different lanuage's standart libraries, such as ]glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/)

### Handling syncronos exceptions

After a syncronos exception is generated, the [handler](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/src/entry.S#L98), wich is registered in the exception table, is called. The handler itself can be found [here](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/src/entry.S#L157) and it starts with the following code.

```
el0_sync:
	kernel_entry 0
	mrs	x25, esr_el1				// read the syndrome register
	lsr	x24, x25, #ESR_ELx_EC_SHIFT		// exception class
	cmp	x24, #ESR_ELx_EC_SVC64			// SVC in 64-bit state
	b.eq	el0_svc
	handle_invalid_entry 0, SYNC_ERROR
```

First of all, as for all exception entries, `kernel_entry` macro is called. Then `esr_el1` (Exception Syndrome Register) is checked. This register contain "exception calss" field at offset [ESR_ELx_EC_SHIFT](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/include/arm/sysregs.h#L46). If exception calss is equal to [ESR_ELx_EC_SVC64](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/include/arm/sysregs.h#L47) this means that curent exception is caused by the `svc` instruction and it is a system call. In this case we jump to `el0_svc` label and show an error message otherwise. 

```
sc_nr	.req	x25					// number of system calls
scno	.req	x26					// syscall number
stbl	.req	x27					// syscall table pointer

el0_svc:
	adr	stbl, sys_call_table			// load syscall table pointer
	uxtw	scno, w8				// syscall number in w8
	mov	sc_nr, #__NR_syscalls
	bl	enable_irq
	cmp     scno, sc_nr                     	// check upper syscall limit
	b.hs	ni_sys

	ldr	x16, [stbl, scno, lsl #3]		// address in the syscall table
	blr	x16					// call sys_* routine
	b	ret_from_syscall
ni_sys:
	handle_invalid_entry 0, SYSCALL_ERROR
```

`el0_svc` first load the address of the syscall table in the `stbl` (it is just an alias to the `x27` register) and requested syscall number in the `scno` variable. Then interrupts are enabled and syscall number is compared to the total number of syscalls in the system - if it is greater or equal a error message is shown. If syscall number falls in the required range it is used as an index in the syscall table array to obtain a pointer to the syscall handler. Next the handler is executed and after it finishes `ret_from_syscall` is called. Note ,that we don't toch here registers `x0` - `x7` - they are transparently passed to the handler.

```
ret_from_syscall:
	bl	disable_irq				
	str	x0, [sp, #S_X0]				// returned x0
	kernel_exit 0
```
`ret_from_syscall` first disables interrupts. Then it saves value of `x0` register on the stack. This is required because `kernel_exit` will restore all general purpose registers from their saved values, but `x0` now contains return values of the syscall handler and we want this value to be passed to the user code. Finally `kernel_exit` is called wich returns to the user code.

### Switching between EL0 and EL1

If you read previous lessons carefully you might notice a change in the `kernel_entry` adn `kernel_exit` macros - now both of them accepts an additional argument. This argument indicates from wich exception level an exception is taken from. The information about the originating exception level is required to properly save/restore stack pointer. Here are the two relevant parts from the `kernel_entry` and `kernel_exit` macros.

```
	.if	\el == 0
	mrs	x21, sp_el0
	.else
	add	x21, sp, #S_FRAME_SIZE
	.endif /* \el == 0 */
```

```
	.if	\el == 0
	msr	sp_el0, x21
	.endif /* \el == 0 */
```

We are using 2 distinct stack pointers for EL0 and EL2, that's why right after an exception is taken from EL0 the stack pointer is owerriter. The original stack pointer can be found in the `sp_el0` register. The value of this register must be stored  and restored before and after taking an exception, even if we don't toch `sp_el0` in the exception handler - othervise you will end up having wrong value in the `sp` register after a context switch. 

You may also ask why don't we restore the value of the `sp` register in case when exception was taken from EL1? That is because we are reusing the same kernel stack  for the excpetion handler. Even if a context switch happens diring an exception processing, by the time of `kernel_exit` macro execution `sp` will be allredy switched by the `cpu_switch_to` function. (By the way, in the linux the behaviour is different, because linux uses different stach for interrupt handlers)

It is also worth noticing, that we don't need to explicily specify to which exception level we need to return before the `eret` instruction. This is because this information is encoded in the `spsr_el1` register, so we always return to the level from wich the exception was taken.

### Moving a task to user mode

Before any syscall can take place we obviously need a task to be executed in user mode. There are 2 opotunities: either a kernel thread will be moved to user mode or a user task can fork itself to create a new user task. In this section we will explore the first posibility.

The function that actually does the job is called [move_to_user_mode](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/src/fork.c#Li47), but before we will look into it let's first examine how this function is used. In order to do so you need to first open [kernel.c](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/src/kernel.c)  file. Let me copy the relevant lines here.

```
	int res = copy_process(PF_KTHREAD, (unsigned long)&kernel_process, 0, 0);
	if (res < 0) {
		printf("error while starting kernel process");
		return;
	}
```

First, in the `kernel_main` function we create a new kernel thread. We do this in the same way as we did it in the previous lesson. After the scheduler runs the newely created task,  `kernel_process` function will be executed in kernel mode.   

```
void kernel_process(){
	printf("Kernel process started. EL %d\r\n", get_el());
	int err = move_to_user_mode((unsigned long)&user_process);
	if (err < 0){
		printf("Error while moving process to user mode\n\r");
	} 
}
```

`kernel_process` then prints status message and calls `move_to_user_mode`, passing pointer to the `user_process` as the first argument. Now let's see what `move_to_user_mode` function is doing.

```
int move_to_user_mode(unsigned long pc)
{
	struct pt_regs *regs = task_pt_regs(current);
	memzero((unsigned long)regs, sizeof(*regs));
	regs->pc = pc;
	regs->pstate = PSR_MODE_EL0t;
	unsigned long stack = get_free_page(); //alocate new user stack
	if (!stack) {
		return -1;
	}
	regs->sp = stack + PAGE_SIZE; 
	current->stack = stack;
	return 0;
}
```

Right now we are in the middle of execution of a kernel thread, that was creaded by forking from the init task. In the previous lesson we've discussed the forking process and we've seen that a small area was reserved at the top of the stack of the newely created task. This is the first time wa are going to use this area: we will save there manually prepared processor state. This sate will have exactly the same format as `kernel_exit` macro expects adn its structure is described by the [pt_regs](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/include/fork.h#L21) struct. 

The following fields of the `pt_regst` structu are initialized in the `move_to_user_mode` function.

* `pc`. It now points to the function that need to be executed in the user mode. `kernel_exit`  will copy `pc` to the `elr_el1` register, thus making sure that we will return to the `pc` address after performing exception return.
* `pstate` This field will be copied to `spsr_el1` by the `kernel_exit` and later will become the processor state after exception return is completed. [PSR_MODE_EL0t](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/include/fork.h#L9) constant, which is copied to the `pstate` field is prepared in such a way that exception return will be made to EL0 level - we already did the same trick in the lesson 2 when switching from EL3 to EL1.
* `stack`. `move_to_user_mode`  allocates new pare for the user stack and sets `sp` field to point to the top of this page.

`task_pt_regs` function is used to calculate the location of the `pt_regs` area. Because ofthe way how we initialized current kernel thread, we are sure that after it finished `sp` will point right before the `pt_regs` area. This happens in the middle of the [ret_from_fork](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/src/entry.S#L188) function.

```
.globl ret_from_fork
ret_from_fork:
	bl	schedule_tail
	cbz	x19, ret_to_user			// not a kernel thread
	mov	x0, x20
	blr	x19
ret_to_user:
	bl disable_irq				
	kernel_exit 0 
```

As you might notice `ret_from_fork` has been updated. Now, after a kernel thread finishes, the execution goes to the `ret_to_user` label, here we disable interrupts and perform normal exception return, using previously prepared processor state.

### Forking user processes

Now let's go back to the `kernel.c` file. As we've seen in the previous section, after `kernel_process` finishes, [user_process](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/src/kernel.c#L22) function will be executed in the user mode. This function calls `clone` system call 2 times in order to  execute [user_process1](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/src/kernel.c#L10) function in 2 parallel threads. `clone` system call requires that the location of a new user stack will be passed to it, we we also need to call `malloc` syscall in order to allocate 2 new memory pages. Let's now take a look on how `clone` syscall looks like. You can find it [here](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/src/sys.S#L22)

```
.globl call_sys_clone
call_sys_clone:
	/* Save args for the child.  */
	mov	x10, x0					/*fn*/
	mov	x11, x1					/*arg*/
	mov	x12, x2					/*stack*/

	/* Do the system call.  */
	mov 	x0, x2					/* stack  */
	mov	x8, #SYS_CLONE_NUMBER
	svc	0x0

	cmp	x0, #0
	beq	thread_start
	ret

thread_start:
	mov	x29, 0

	/* Pick the function arg and execute.  */
	mov	x0, x11
	blr	x10

	/* We are done, pass the return value through x0.  */
	mov	x8, #SYS_EXIT_NUMBER
	svc	0x0
```

In the design of the `clone` syscall wrapping function I tried to emulate the behaviour of the [coresponding function](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/aarch64/clone.S;h=e0653048259dd9a3d3eb3103ec2ae86acb43ef48;hb=HEAD#l35) from the `glibc` library. This function does the following.

1. Saves registers `x0` - `x3`, those registers contains parameters of th syscall and later will be overriten by the syscall handler.
1. Calls syscall handler.
1. Chaeck return value of the syscall handler: it it is `0` this means that we return here rigth after the syscall finishes and we are  executing inside the original thread - just return to the caler in this case.
1. If return value is non 0, then it is PID of the newely allocated task and we are executing inside newely created thred.  In this case execution goes to `thread_start`  label.
1. The function, originally passed as the first argument is called.
1. After the function finishes `exit` syscall is called - it never returns.

As you can see, the semantics of the clone wrapper function and clone syscall differ: the former accepts pointer to the function to be executed as an argument and the later return to the caller twice:  first time in the original task  and second time in the cloned task.

Clone syscall handler can be found [here](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/src/sys.c#L11). It is very simple and it just calls already familiar `copy_cprocess` function. This function, however, have been modified since the last lesson - now it supports cloning user threads as well as kernel threads. The source of the function is listed below.

```
int copy_process(unsigned long clone_flags, unsigned long fn, unsigned long arg, unsigned long stack)
{
	preempt_disable();
	struct task_struct *p;

	p = (struct task_struct *) get_free_page();
	if (!p) {
		return -1;
	}

	struct pt_regs *childregs = task_pt_regs(p);
	memzero((unsigned long)childregs, sizeof(struct pt_regs));
	memzero((unsigned long)&p->cpu_context, sizeof(struct cpu_context));

	if (clone_flags & PF_KTHREAD) {
		p->cpu_context.x19 = fn;
		p->cpu_context.x20 = arg;
	} else {
		struct pt_regs * cur_regs = task_pt_regs(current);
		*cur_regs = *childregs;
		childregs->regs[0] = 0;
		childregs->sp = stack + PAGE_SIZE; 
		p->stack = stack;
	}
	p->flags = clone_flags;
	p->priority = current->priority;
	p->state = TASK_RUNNING;
	p->counter = p->priority;
	p->preempt_count = 1; //disable preemtion untill schedule_tail

	p->cpu_context.pc = (unsigned long)ret_from_fork;
	p->cpu_context.sp = (unsigned long)childregs;
	int pid = nr_tasks++;
	task[pid] = p;	
	preempt_enable();
	return pid;
}
```

In case  when we are creating a new kernel thread, the function behaves exactly the same, as was described in the previous lesson. In the second cease, when we are cloning a user thread, this part of the code is executed.

```
		struct pt_regs * cur_regs = task_pt_regs(current);
		*cur_regs = *childregs;
		childregs->regs[0] = 0;
		childregs->sp = stack + PAGE_SIZE; 
		p->stack = stack;
```

The first thing that we are doing here is getting access to the processor state, saved by the `kernle_entry` macro. It is not obious, however, why we can use the same `task_pt_regs` function, wich just return `pt_regs` area at the top of the kernel stack? Why isn't it posible that `pt_regs` will be stored somewhere else on the stack? The answer is that this code can be executed only after `clone` syscall was called. At the time when syscall was triggered current kernel stack was empty (we left it empty after moving to user mode). That's why pt_regs``will always be stored at the top of the kernel stack. This rule will be keept for all subesequent syscalls, because each of them will leave kernel stack empty before ruturning to user mode.

In the second line current processor state is copied to the new task's state. `x0` in the new state is set to `0`, because `x0` will be interpreted by  the caller as a return value of the syscall. We've just seen how clone wrapper function uses this value to determine whether we are still executing as a part of the original thread or a new one.

Next `sp` for the new task is set to point to the top of the new user stack page. We also save pointer to the stack page in order to do a cleanup after the task finishes.

### Exiting a task

After each user tasks finishes it should call `exit` syscall (In the current implementation `exit` is called implicitly by the `clone` wrapper function).  `exit` syscall then calls [exit_process](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os/blob/master/src/lesson05/src/sched.c) function, wich is responsible for deactivating  a task. The function is listed below.

```
void exit_process(){
	preempt_disable();
	for (int i = 0; i < NR_TASKS; i++){
		if (task[i] == current) {
			task[i]->state = TASK_ZOMBIE;
			break;
		}
	}
	if (current->stack) {
		free_page(current->stack);
	}
	preempt_enable();
	schedule();
}
```

Following linux convention we are not deleting the task at once , but set it state to `TASK_ZOMBIE` instead. This will prevent the task from being selected by and executed by the sceduler. In linux such aproach is used to allow parent process to query information about child event after it finishes.  

`exit_process` also deletes now unnecesary user stack and calls `schedule`. After `schedule` is called new task will be selected, that's why this system call neer returns.

### Conclusion

Now, when RPi OS can manage user tasks, we becoe much closer to the full process isolation. But one important step is still missing: all user tasks share the same physical memory and can easily read one another's data. In the next lesson we are going to introduce virtual memory, that should fix this issue.
