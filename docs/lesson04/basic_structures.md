## Lesson 4: Basic scheduler structures and concepts  

In all previous lessons we have been working mostly with either architecture specific code or driver code - and not it is the first time we will dig deep into the core of the linux kernel. This task isn't simple and it requires some preparations: before you will be able to understand linux schedule source code you need to become familiar with a few major conceprs that the schedule is based on.

### [task_struct](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/include/linux/sched.h#L519)

This is one of the most inportant structures in the whole kernel - it contains all information about a running task. We already brefly touched `task_struct`  in lesson 2 and we even have implemented our own `task_struct` for RPi OS - so I assume that by this time you should already have a basic understanding of how it is used. Now I want to highlit a few important fielld of this struct that are relevant for our discussion.

* [thread_info](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/include/linux/sched.h#L525) This is the first field of the `task_struct` and it contains all fields that must be accessed by low level architecture assembler code. We have allready seen how this happens in lesson 2 and will encounter a few other examples leater. [thread_info](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/arch/arm64/include/asm/thread_info.h#L39) is architecture specific. In `arm64` case it is a simple structure with a few fields.
  ```
  struct thread_info {
          unsigned long		flags;		/* low level flags */
          mm_segment_t		addr_limit;	/* address limit */
  #ifdef CONFIG_ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN
          u64			ttbr0;		/* saved TTBR0_EL1 */
  #endif
          int			preempt_count;	/* 0 => preemptable, <0 => bug */
  };
  ```
  `flags` field is used very frequently - it contains information about task current state (whether it is under a trace, whether a signal is pending, etc.) All posible flags values can be found [here](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/arch/arm64/include/asm/thread_info.h#L79)
* [state](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/include/linux/sched.h#L528) Task current state (whether it is currently running, waiting for an interrupt, exited etc.)aAll posible task states are described [here](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/include/linux/sched.h#L69)
* [stack](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/include/linux/sched.h#L536) When working on RPi OS we have seen that `task_struct` is always kept at the bottom of the task stack, so we can use a pointer to `task_struct` as a pointer to the stack. Kernel stacks are have constant size, so finding stack end is also an easy task. I think that the same approach was used in the early versions of Linux kernel, right now, however, `stack` field is used to store pointer to the kernel stack.
* [thread](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/include/linux/sched.h#L1108) Another important architecture specific structure is [thread_struct](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/arch/arm64/include/asm/processor.h#L81). It contains all information (such as [cpu_context](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/arch/arm64/include/asm/processor.h#L65)) that is used during a context switch. In fact RPi OS implements its own `cpu_context` that is used exactly in the same way as the original one.
* [sched_class and sched_entity](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/include/linux/sched.h#L562-L563) Those fields are used in schedule algorithm - more on them follows.

### Scheduler class

In linux there is an extendable mechanizm that allows each task to used its own scheduing algorithm. This mechaniz uses a structure [sched_class](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/kernel/sched/sched.h#L1400). You can think about this structure as an interface that defines all methods needed to implement a new schedule algorithm. Let's see what kind of methods are defined in `sched_class` interface. (Not all of the methods are shown, but only those wich I conside the most important)

* [enqueue_task](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/kernel/sched/sched.h#L1403) is executed each time a new task is added to a scheduler class.
* [dequeue_task](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/kernel/sched/sched.h#L1404) is called when task can be removed from the scheduler class.
* [pick_next_task](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/kernel/sched/sched.h#L1418) Core scheduler code calls this method when it needs to decide wich task to run next.
* [task_tick](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/kernel/sched/sched.h#L1437) is called on each timer tick and gives the cheduler class an oportunity to measure how long current task is being executeed and notify core scheduler code if it need to be preempted.

There are a few `sched_class` implementations. The most commonly used one, wich is typically used for all user tasks, is called "Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)".

### Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)

The main idea behind CFS algorithm is very simple: 
1. For each task in the system CFS measures how much CPU time has been already allocated to it (The value is stored in [sum_exec_runtime](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/include/linux/sched.h#L385) field of the `sched_entity` structure) 
1. `sum_exec_runtime` is adjusted acordigly to task priority and saved in [vruntime](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/include/linux/sched.h#L386) field.
1. When CFS need to pick a new task to execute, the one with the smallest `vruntime` is selected.

Linux scheduler uses another important data sctructure that is called runqueue and is described by the [rq](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/kernel/sched/sched.h#L667) structre. There is one instance of a runqueue per CPU. When a new task need to be selected for execution the selection is made only from the local runqueue, but if there is a need, tasks can be balanced between different `rq` structures. 

Runqueues are used by all scheduler classes, not only by CFS. All CFS specific information is kept in [cfs_rq](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/kernel/sched/sched.h#L420) struct, wich is embeded in the `rq` struct. One important field of the `cfs_rq` struct is called [min_vruntime](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/kernel/sched/sched.h#L425) - this is the lowest `vruntime` from all tasks, assigned to a runqueue. `min_vruntime` is assigned to a newely foked task - this ensures that the task will be selected next, because CFS always ensures that a task with the smallest `vruntime` is selected. This also ensures that the task will not be running for unreasonably loong timer, before it will be preempted.

All tasks, assigned to a particular runqueue and tracked by CFS are kept in [tasks_timeline](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/kernel/sched/sched.h#L430) field of the `cfs_rq` struct. `tasks_timeline` represents a [Redâ€“black tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree), wich can be used to pick all tasks sorted by there `vruntime` value. Red-black trees have an important property: all operations on it (search, insert, delete) can be done in [O(log n)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) time. This means that even if we have thousands of concurent tasks in the system all sheduler methods still executes very quickly. Another important property of a red-black tree is that for any node in the tree its right child will always have learger `vruntime` value then the parent and left child's `vruntime` will be always less or equal then the parent's `vruntime`. This has an important implication that the leftmost node is always the one with the smallest `vruntime`.

### [struct pt_regs](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.14/arch/arm64/include/asm/ptrace.h#L119) 

I have already shown you how all general purpose registers are saved on the stack when an interrupt is taken - we explored how this process works in linux kernel and implemented a similar one for the RPi OS. What I haven't mentioned yet is that it is fully legal to manipulate those registers while processing an interrupt. It is also legal to prepare a fake set of registers and put them on the stack - this is done when a kernel thread is moved to a user mode and we are going to implement the same functionality in the next lesson. For now you just need to remember that `pt_regs` structure is used to describe saved registers and it must have its fields ordered in the same order in with register are saved in the `kernel_entry` macro. In this lesson we are going to see a few examples of how this strcture is used.

### Conclusion

There are far more important structures, algorithms and concepts related to scheduling, but what we've just explored is a minimal set, requred to understand the next two chapters. Now it's time to see how all of this actually works.
