## Lesson 4: Exercises

1. Add `printf` to all main kernel functions to output information about curent memory state. Make sure that the memory state diagrams, that i've added to the end of the RPi OS part of this lesson are correct.  (You not neceserraly need to output all memory state each time, but as soon as some major event happens you can output current stack pointer, or address of the object that has just been allocated, or whatever you consider necessary) 
1. Introduce a way to assign priority to the tasks. Make sure that task with hier priority gets more processor time that the one with lower priority.
